April, June, September, and November have 30 days, 
February has 28 days, 
and the rest of the months have 31 days. 
February has 29 days in leap years. 
Leap years are every year evenly divisible by 4,

unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400. 
Note how this calculation makes it impossible to make a reasonably sized
